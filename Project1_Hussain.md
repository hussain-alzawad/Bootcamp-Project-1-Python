# Number Analysis Project

This python project analyzes a list of numbers and perform multiple operations including sum, average, maximum, and minimum of the numbers. It also identifies even, odd, and prime numbers from the list.

## Project Structure

**isEven**" that is a lambda function which checks if a number is even 
**isPrime** function that checks if a number is a prime
**analyzeNumbers** which is the main function that combines both **isEven** and **isPrime** functions along with equations to analyze the list. The output of this function is a dictionary that combines all the calculated results.

## Project Features

- functions that calculate desired output 
- utilizing the lambda function for simple calculations 
- using a *dictionary* to save results, *list* to feed the function and *set* for distinct values 

## How to use

modify the list to fit your needs and run the program cell by cell 

## Results

Assuming the list = [21,12,12,32,43,3,2,1,1,54,6]

the output would be the follwing: 

The evenNumbers in the list is/are: {32, 2, 6, 12, 54}
The oddNumbers in the list is/are: {3, 1, 43, 21}
The sum in the list is/are: 187
The average in the list is/are: 17.0
The maximum in the list is/are: 54
The minimum in the list is/are: 1
The uniqueNumbers in the list is/are: {32, 1, 2, 3, 6, 43, 12, 21, 54}
The sorted in the list is/are: [1, 1, 2, 3, 6, 12, 12, 21, 32, 43, 54]
The primeNumbers in the list is/are: {3, 1, 2, 43}
